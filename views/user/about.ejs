Established on March 28, 2001, our journey began on a significant note â€“ the birthday of our founder, Salmanul Faris. Back then, the reins were held by Salmanul's father, marking the inception of a fashion legacy that has stood the test of time.

As we fast forward to the present, Salmanul Faris has taken the helm, steering COZA Fashion Store into a new era of elegance and trendsetting fashion. Our roots are deep, and our commitment to providing the best in fashion remains unwavering.
